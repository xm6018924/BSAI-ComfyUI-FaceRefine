    default) puts even the last split point of a short schedule at an effective sigma

    close: the tiny-face frames have no detail to preserve and want a strong pass so H3
    SYNTHESISES a face, while the large-face frames have real detail and want a gentle one
    so it is not rewritten. One value cannot serve both.

    ComfyUI's noise_mask scales denoising per latent position, so varying it along the
    temporal axis gives per-frame strength out of a single sampling pass. Place this AFTER
    MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock - it preserves that node's audio-side zeros, which are what
    keep the audio clean and drive lipsync.

    A mask alone is not enough. H3 hands a held region back nearly clean and relies on
    per-token timesteps to declare it as such; this node withholds the video mask from
    those timesteps, so instead it re-noises the held frames to the sigma the sampler is
    on. The latent is then simply true for the step it is on, and nothing needs

    Impact Pack's best-quality path is bbox + SAM: the bbox seeds a point/box prompt and

    hairline rather than on an arbitrary rectangle.

    Runs on the INPUT crops, exactly as FaceDetailer computes its mask from the source
    image before enhancement and then pastes the enhanced patch through it.

    Video-specific addition: SAM is run per frame and the resulting mask stack is
    temporally smoothed. Per-frame segmentation wobbles by a few pixels, and an unsmoothed
    mask boundary flickers - which is exactly the artefact this whole pipeline exists to
    avoid. Smoothing is cheap and meaningful here precisely because the crops are
    face-stabilised, so the masks are already roughly aligned.
